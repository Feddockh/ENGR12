Dear Will and John, this is the resposity for our final project. If you click into the sorting file, that is where our sorting algorithm will be stored. In the other file called data generator, I have currently made an algorithm that will provide you data to work with when creating the sorting algorithm. To work on this code, you will want to download the zip file, unzip it and work on it in the geany IDE. When you have made changes, click back into the file on github, and in the top right corner you should see a place where you can create a new branch. Give that branch a name and copy/paste your code or upload the file. Scroll to the bottom and you should see a button that says you can save it as a new branch and submit a pull request. Do that and then I'll be able to see your revisions before adding your changes to the main branch of code.
